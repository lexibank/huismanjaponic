## Notes from the Authors on the Data Origins

> We created a new comparative dataset based on the 100-item Swadesh List ([32]; see also Table 1)—a list of what are considered to be basic concepts, such as body parts and everyday actions. The Swadesh List is well-established in both large-scale and small-scale comparative studies [33,34]. In light of recent findings that the lexicon may be more stable over time than grammatical features [35], we take this list of basic concepts to be a good starting point for comparison. We built on the database collated by Lee and Hasegawa [29], like them using the six-volume Dictionary of Contemporary Japanese Dialects [36], but additionally coding the data to preserve all distinctions present in the original material (unlike Lee and Hasegawa, see their Data Supplement 2). Furthermore, we include an additional 11 (mostly island) varieties over the original Lee and Hasegawa database. In addition, we collated data from Volumes 1–3 and 7 of The Complete Works of Tōsō Miyara [37], to add another 22 Ryukyuan varieties. Miyara was a Ryukyu-born phonetician, and speaker of one of the local varieties, whose works have been used as a reliable source of contemporary variation, e.g., for the reconstruction of Proto-Ryukyuan [38]. Due to incomplete source material, the eventual dataset contained data for 98 out of the 100 Swadesh List items (Table 1). The data set is available through an Open Science Framework (OSF) archive at https://osf.io/8cxry/. In total, 58 Japanese and 32 Ryukyuan varieties are represented in the data set—see S1 Supporting information for a map of location names).
